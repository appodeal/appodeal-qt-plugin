# Appodeal QT plugin

## Download SDK

You can download Appodeal plugin for QT here.

Minimum OS requirements: Android API level 9 (Android OS 2.3).

Android Appodeal SDK version 1.15.9

iOS Appodeal SDK version 1.3.9

## QT Integration

### SDK files

Download the plugin and unzip it into your project directory. Open *.pro file from your project and add the following line:

```
include(Appodeal/Appodeal.pri)
```

### Android Integration

Also copy TARGET value from *.pro file, open Appodeal/android/AndroidManifest.xml in text editor, find the following line:
```
<meta-data android:name="android.app.lib_name" android:value="AppodealDemo"/>
```
And replace AppodealDemo with your TARGET value.

### iOS Integration

After building iOS Project you will get error: `Appodeal.framework/Appodeal(AVHttpClient.o)' does not contain bitcode. You must rebuild it with bitcode enabled (Xcode setting ENABLE_BITCODE), obtain an updated library from the vendor, or disable bitcode for this target. for architecture arm64` don't worry, just open compiled xcode project, go to `Build Settings` Set `Enable Bitcode` to `No` and remove `-fembed-bitcode-marker` flag from  `Other Linker Flags`.
Now you can succesfully build your project.

### Ad types

Appodeal::INTERSTITIAL

Appodeal::SKIPPABLE_VIDEO

Appodeal::BANNER

Appodeal::BANNER_TOP

Appodeal::BANNER_BOTTOM

Appodeal::REWARDED_VIDEO

Appodeal::NON_SKIPPABLE_VIDEO

Ad types can be combined using "|" operator. For example Appodeal::INTERSTITIAL | Appodeal::SKIPPABLE_VIDEO

Note that it is better to use NON_SKIPPABLE_VIDEO or REWARDED_VIDEO, but if you are sure you want to use SKIPPABLE_VIDEO you must confirm usage by calling Appodeal::confirm(Appodeal::SKIPPABLE_VIDEO) before SDK initialization

### SDK initialization

Import Appodeal header to your code:
```
#include "Appodeal/appodealads.h"
```
To initialize SDK you need to add following code:

```
QString appKey = "fee50c333ff3825fd6ad6d38cff78154de3025546d47a84f";
Appodeal::initialize(appKey, Appodeal::BANNER | Appodeal::INTERSTITIAL);
```

Note: appKey is the key you received when you created an app.

To initialize only interstitials use Appodeal::initialize(appKey, Appodeal::INTERSTITIAL)

To initialize only skippable videos use Appodeal::initialize(appKey, Appodeal::SKIPPABLE_VIDEO)

To initialize interstitials and videos use Appodeal::initialize(appKey, Appodeal::INTERSTITIAL | Appodeal::SKIPPABLE_VIDEO)

To initialize only banners use Appodeal::initialize(appKey, Appodeal::BANNER)

To initialize only rewarded video use Appodeal::initialize(appKey, Appodeal::REWARDED_VIDEO)

To initialize only non-skippable video use Appodeal::initialize(appKey, Appodeal::NON_SKIPPABLE_VIDEO)

###. Display ad

```
Appodeal::show(adTypes);
```

show() returns a boolean value indicating whether show call was passed to appropriate SDK

To display interstitial use Appodeal::show(Appodeal::INTERSTITIAL)

To display skippable video use Appodeal::show(Appodeal::SKIPPABLE_VIDEO)

To display rewarded video use Appodeal::show(Appodeal::REWARDED_VIDEO)

To display non-skippable video use Appodeal::show(Appodeal::NON_SKIPPABLE_VIDEO)

To display interstitial or video use Appodeal::show(Appodeal::INTERSTITIAL | Appodeal::SKIPPABLE_VIDEO)

To display banner at the bottom of the screen use sppodeal::Show(Appodeal::BANNER_BOTTOM)

To display banner at the top of the screen use Appodeal::show(Appodeal::BANNER_TOP)

### Hiding banner

To hide banner you need to call the following code:

```
Appodeal::hide(Appodeal::BANNER);
```

### Samples

Display interstitial after it was loaded

```
void YourClassName::onInterstitialLoaded(bool isPrecache){
	Appodeal::show(Appodeal::INTERSTITIAL);
}

Appodeal::setAutoCache(Appodeal::INTERSTITIAL, false);
Appodeal::initialize(appKey, Appodeal::INTERSTITIAL);
Appodeal::cache(Appodeal::INTERSTITIAL);
Appodeal::setInterstitialCallback(this);
```

Your class must extend InterstitialCallbacks from Appodeal/interstitialcallbacks.h.

Display interstitial after app launch

```
Appodeal::initialize(appKey, Appodeal::INTERSTITIAL);
Appodeal::show(Appodeal::INTERSTITIAL);
```

`Note: showing fullscreen ads immediately after app launch doesn't allowed. Also, if an ad has not uploaded yet, you will see a loader, which will be disappeared after few seconds`

#### Enabling or disabling automatic caching

```
Appodeal::setAutoCache(adTypes, false);
```

Should be used before SDK initialization

To disable automatic caching for interstitials use Appodeal::setAutoCache(Appodeal::INTERSTITIAL, false)

To disable automatic caching for skippable videos use Appodeal::setAutoCache(Appodeal::SKIPPABLE_VIDEO, false)

To disable automatic caching for non-skippable videos use Appodeal::setAutoCache(Appodeal::NON_SKIPPABLE_VIDEO, false)

#### Triggering onLoaded callback twice

```
Appodeal::setOnLoadedTriggerBoth(adTypes, true);
```

Currently supported only for interstitials

setOnLoadedTriggerBoth(Appodeal::INTERSTITIAL, false) - onInterstitialLoaded will trigger only when normal ad was loaded (default).

setOnLoadedTriggerBoth(Appodeal::INTERSTITIAL, true) - onInterstitialLoaded will trigger twice, both when precache and normal ad were loaded.

Should be used before SDK initialization.

#### Disabling networks

```
Appodeal::disableNetwork("networkName");
```

Also, itâ€™s possible to disable network only for specific ad types.

```
Appodeal::disableNetwork("networkName", adTypes);
```

Available parameters: "amazon_ads", "applovin", "chartboost", "mopub", "unity_ads", "mailru", "facebook", "adcolony", "vungle", "yandex", "startapp", "avocarrot", "flurry", "pubnative", "cheetah", "inner-active", "revmob".

Should be used before SDK initialization

#### Remove adapters from Project

First of all, it's required  to disable network, which you want to remove.
```
Appodeal::disableNetwork("startapp");
```

After that, you can remove unused jar files from libs folder of Appodeal plugin. Some networks are included in appodeal-1.15.5.jar file. You can open it via an archiver and remove unused dex files from assets/dex folder.

#### Disabling location permission check

To disable toast messages ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION permission is missing use the following method:

```
Appodeal::disableLocationPermissionCheck();
```

Should be used before SDK initialization.

`Note: disabling location permission may have a negative impact on your revenue`

#### Disabling write external storage permission check

To disable toast messages WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission is missing use the following method:

```
Appodeal::disableWriteExternalStoragePermissionCheck();
```

Should be used before SDK initialization.

`Note: some networks don't work without write external storage permission. They will be disabled in your application.`

#### Tracking in-app purchase

```
Appodeal::trackInAppPurchase(currencyCode, amount);
```

Tracks in-app purchase information and sends info to our servers for analytics. Example:

```
Appodeal::trackInAppPurchase("USD", 5);
```
