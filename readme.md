# Appodeal QT plugin

## Download SDK

You can download Appodeal plugin for QT [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/download-here-green.svg)](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/appodeal-qt/Appodeal-Qt-110417-2.0.0.zip) .

Minimum OS requirements: Android API level 9 (Android OS 2.3).

Android Appodeal SDK version 2.1.9

iOS Appodeal SDK version 1.3.9

## QT Integration

### SDK files

Download the plugin and unzip it into your project directory. Open *.pro file from your project and add the following line:

```
include(Appodeal/Appodeal.pri)
```

### Android Integration

Copy Appodeal/android directory to your AndroidManifest.xml location and rename it to AppodealLib. If you don't have custom AndroidManifest.xml file, you can create it from QT Creator: Projects -> Build -> Build Android APK -> Create Templates

#### If you use ant build system
Create project.properties file if it doesn't exists in your AndroidManifest.xml location and add the following lines:
```
android.library.reference.1=./AppodealLib
manifestmerger.enabled=true
```

Also, you should open AppodealLib/AndroidManifest.xml, find "${applicationId}" text and replace it with your bundle id. Gradle will perform it automatically.

#### If you use gradle build system
Cteate settings.gradle file if it doesn't exist in your AndroidManifest.xml location and add the following lines:
```
include ':AppodealLib'
include ':adcolony-gradle'
project(':adcolony-gradle').projectDir = new File('AppodealLib/adcolony-gradle')
include ':mmedia-gradle'
project(':mmedia-gradle').projectDir = new File('AppodealLib/mmedia-gradle')
```
Then open build.gradle file from the same location, find dependencies section (which is not inside of buildscript section) and add AppodealLib project. The final result should looks something like this:
```
dependencies {
    compile fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.jar'])
	compile project(':AppodealLib')
}
```
### iOS Integration

After building iOS Project you will get error: `Appodeal.framework/Appodeal(AVHttpClient.o)' does not contain bitcode. You must rebuild it with bitcode enabled (Xcode setting ENABLE_BITCODE), obtain an updated library from the vendor, or disable bitcode for this target. for architecture arm64` don't worry, just open compiled xcode project, go to `Build Settings` Set `Enable Bitcode` to `No` and remove `-fembed-bitcode-marker` flag from  `Other Linker Flags`.
Now you can succesfully build your project.

### Ad types

AppodealAds::INTERSTITIAL

AppodealAds::BANNER

AppodealAds::BANNER_TOP

AppodealAds::BANNER_BOTTOM

AppodealAds::REWARDED_VIDEO

AppodealAds::NON_SKIPPABLE_VIDEO

Ad types can be combined using "|" operator. For example AppodealAds::INTERSTITIAL | AppodealAds::SKIPPABLE_VIDEO

### SDK initialization

Import Appodeal header to your code:
```
#include "Appodeal/appodealads.h"
```
To initialize SDK you need to add following code:

```
QString appKey = "fee50c333ff3825fd6ad6d38cff78154de3025546d47a84f";
AppodealAds::initialize(appKey, AppodealAds::BANNER | AppodealAds::INTERSTITIAL);
```

Note: appKey is the key you received when you created an app.

To initialize only interstitials use AppodealAds::initialize(appKey, AppodealAds::INTERSTITIAL)

To initialize interstitials and videos use AppodealAds::initialize(appKey, AppodealAds::INTERSTITIAL | AppodealAds::SKIPPABLE_VIDEO)

To initialize only banners use AppodealAds::initialize(appKey, AppodealAds::BANNER)

To initialize only rewarded video use AppodealAds::initialize(appKey, AppodealAds::REWARDED_VIDEO)

To initialize only non-skippable video use AppodealAds::initialize(appKey, AppodealAds::NON_SKIPPABLE_VIDEO)

###. Display ad

```
AppodealAds::show(adTypes);
```

show() returns a boolean value indicating whether show call was passed to appropriate SDK

To display interstitial use AppodealAds::show(AppodealAds::INTERSTITIAL)

To display rewarded video use AppodealAds::show(AppodealAds::REWARDED_VIDEO)

To display non-skippable video use AppodealAds::show(AppodealAds::NON_SKIPPABLE_VIDEO)

To display banner at the bottom of the screen use sppodeal::Show(AppodealAds::BANNER_BOTTOM)

To display banner at the top of the screen use AppodealAds::show(AppodealAds::BANNER_TOP)

### Hiding banner

To hide banner you need to call the following code:

```
AppodealAds::hide(AppodealAds::BANNER);
```

### Samples

Display interstitial after it was loaded

```
void YourClassName::onInterstitialLoaded(bool isPrecache){
	AppodealAds::show(AppodealAds::INTERSTITIAL);
}

AppodealAds::setAutoCache(AppodealAds::INTERSTITIAL, false);
AppodealAds::initialize(appKey, AppodealAds::INTERSTITIAL);
AppodealAds::cache(AppodealAds::INTERSTITIAL);
AppodealAds::setInterstitialCallback(this);
```

Your class must extend InterstitialCallbacks from Appodeal/interstitialcallbacks.h.

Display interstitial after app launch

```
AppodealAds::initialize(appKey, AppodealAds::INTERSTITIAL);
AppodealAds::show(AppodealAds::INTERSTITIAL);
```

`Note: showing fullscreen ads immediately after app launch doesn't allowed. Also, if an ad has not uploaded yet, you will see a loader, which will be disappeared after few seconds`

To cache rewarded video use AppodealAds::cache(AppodealAds::REWARDED_VIDEO)

To cache non-skippable video use AppodealAds::cache(AppodealAds::NON_SKIPPABLE_VIDEO)

#### Enabling or disabling automatic caching

```
AppodealAds::setAutoCache(adTypes, false);

#### Triggering onLoaded callback twice

```
AppodealAds::setOnLoadedTriggerBoth(adTypes, true);
```

Currently supported only for interstitials

setOnLoadedTriggerBoth(AppodealAds::INTERSTITIAL, false) - onInterstitialLoaded will trigger only when normal ad was loaded (default).

setOnLoadedTriggerBoth(AppodealAds::INTERSTITIAL, true) - onInterstitialLoaded will trigger twice, both when precache and normal ad were loaded.

Should be used before SDK initialization.

#### Disabling networks

```
AppodealAds::disableNetwork("networkName");
```

Also, itâ€™s possible to disable network only for specific ad types.

```
AppodealAds::disableNetwork("networkName", adTypes);

#### Remove adapters from Project

First of all, it's required  to disable network, which you want to remove.
```
AppodealAds::disableNetwork("startapp");
```

After that, you can remove unused jar files from libs folder of Appodeal plugin. Some networks are included in appodeal-1.15.5.jar file. You can open it via an archiver and remove unused dex files from assets/dex folder.

#### Disabling location permission check

To disable toast messages ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION permission is missing use the following method:

```
AppodealAds::disableLocationPermissionCheck();
```

Should be used before SDK initialization.

`Note: disabling location permission may have a negative impact on your revenue`

#### Disabling write external storage permission check

To disable toast messages WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission is missing use the following method:

```
AppodealAds::disableWriteExternalStoragePermissionCheck();
```

Should be used before SDK initialization.

`Note: some networks don't work without write external storage permission. They will be disabled in your application.`

#### Tracking in-app purchase

```
AppodealAds::trackInAppPurchase(currencyCode, amount);
```

Tracks in-app purchase information and sends info to our servers for analytics. Example:

```
AppodealAds::trackInAppPurchase("USD", 5);
```

### Setting user data.
Initialization
